# My ASCII Hangman Game

This is a basic hangman game I implemented in Python using ASCII characters.

It took me only an hour to code the basics, and only an additional fifteen minutes or so to code in some bug fixes and updates.

This project is complete at a basic level, but I'm thinking of what improvements I could make to it...
